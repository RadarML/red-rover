# Red Rover: A Multimodal mmWave Radar Spectrum Ecosystem

The **red rover** project is an end-to-end system for collecting, loading, and processing mmWave radar time signal data along with lidar and camera data designed for both [DART](https://wiselabcmu.github.io/dart/)-style reconstruction and [GRT](https://wiselabcmu.github.io/grt/)-style deep learning.

> [!TIP]
> While packaged together as a mono-repo, each module is designed to be able to be installed and used separately. See each module's documentation for requirements and setup instructions.

See our [documentation site](https://radarml.github.io/red-rover/) for more details!
